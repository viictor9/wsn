WSN Practical 7

Aim: Create MAC protocol simulation implementation for wireless sensor Network.

Steps:-

1.Create the following network

2.Click on Every laptop and change the interface to WPC300n module.

3.Copy the MAC address of each component as follows.

4.We note the following MAC address and convert them to the following form
Component		MAC Address	Converted MAC Address
Laptop0			000C.CF8D.E7E0	00:0C:CF:8D:E7:E0
PC0			0001.C967.9504	00:01:C9:67:95:04
PC1			000D.BD14.DDCC	00:0D:BD:14:DD:CC
SmartPhone0		0002.4A2A.B871	00:02:4A:2A:B8:71
	


5.Now we add few address in the wireless MAC filter of the Wireless Router 
and then use the given options for either allow or deny the wireless access.

6.As seen in above screenshot we add the MAC address of 
Laptop0,TabletPC,SmartPhone0 in the list so as to deny them accessing 
the Wireless network and then save the settings.
The result so obtained is as shown, the three devices denied any wireless
 connectivity.


7.Similarly we can change the settings so that the above devices
 get wireless connectivity and the remaining devices do not get 
the wireless connectivity.

8.And save the setting and get the following
